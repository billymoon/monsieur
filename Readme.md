# Sir

## The polite development server

- serves as plain or pre-processed (on-the-fly):
  - coffee-script
  - less
  - sass/scss
  - stylus
  - markdown
  - jade
  - slim
- literate style coffee-script, js, jade, slim, stylus, etc... even md :-) all Ã  la coffee script litrate style (via [npm/illiterate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/illiterate))
- CORS
- request logging
- beautified pre-processor output
- livereload
- execute shell command on request
- save cache of requested files (useful for pre-processed output)
- path based proxy (useful to proxy to api server, or assets from live site)
- multiple server roots
- aliased server roots

## Installation

    $ npm install -g sir

          --cache <cache-folder>  store copy of each served file in `cache` folder
          --no-livereload         disable livereload watching served directory (add `lr` to querystring of requested resource to inject client script)

## Examples

HTTP Accept support...

Assuming server runnung with something like... `sir .`

     $ curl http://localhost:8080/ -H "Accept: text/plain"
     bin
     History.md
     node_modules
     ...

Requesting a file:

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/Readme.md
    # Sir

    ## The polite development server
    ...

Requesting JSON for the directory listing:

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/ -H "Accept: application/json"
    [
      "bin",
      "History.md",
      "node_modules"
      ...
    ]

## Extra Awesomeness

You can install of vendor libraries to be additionally served up from a `vendor` folder...

    $ cd $(sir --vendor-path)
    $ npm run fetch -- moment underscore
    $ npm run vendor

Now you can run `sir . vendor:$(sir --vendor-path)`, with vendor files served from `http://localhost:8080/vendor`.

(this feature uses [bower-installer](https://github.com/blittle/bower-installer) under the hood)

**N.B.** this feature should be moved into a `sir` command - something like `sir fetch moment` - pull requests welcome :)
