# Literate markdown (inception)

In order to write a document demonstrating markdown, and be able to pull
out the sample code, the comment indented markdown is the inner markdown
which is extracted during illiteration.

## Examples

Headings are incremented by adding more `#` to the front...

    # This is a heading one
    ## This is a heading two
    ### This is a heading three

Ordered lists don't need to specify actual numbers...

    0. this is ordered list
    0. this is ordered list

Much easier to maintain, as inserting does not require re-calculating entire list indexes.
